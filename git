git commit --amend --author="Gaurav Yadav <gary391@gmail.com>" --no-edit --> This is command to make the change

A-B-C-D-E-F with F as HEAD, and you want to change the author of C and D, then you would
1. git rebase -i <B-commit>
    2. Identify the commit you would like to change in the terminal window
    3. change pick to edit

        pick 1fc6c95 Patch A
        pick 6b2481b Patch B
        pick dd1475d something I want to split
        pick c619268 A fix for Patch B
        pick fa39187 something to add to patch A
        pick 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods
        pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B

        # Rebase 41a72e6..7b36971 onto 41a72e6
        #
        # Commands:
        #  p, pick = use commit
        #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
        #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
        #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
        #  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
        #  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
        #
        # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
        # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
        #

        :wq
    4. git commit --amend --author="Gaurav Yadav <gary391@gmail.com>" --no-edit
